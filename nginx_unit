   1. Download NGINX’s signing key and add it to apt’s keyring:

    # curl -sL https://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key | apt-key add -

    This eliminates the ‘packages cannot be authenticated’ warnings during installation.

   2. To configure Unit repository, create the following file named /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unit.list:

    deb https://packages.nginx.org/unit/ubuntu/ xenial unit
    deb-src https://packages.nginx.org/unit/ubuntu/ xenial unit

   3.  Install Unit base package and other packages you would like to use:

    # apt update
    # apt install unit
    # apt install unit-dev unit-go unit-jsc8 unit-perl unit-php \
