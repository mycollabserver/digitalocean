Set Static IP Address in Debian / Ubuntu (*****DONE****)
To setup static IP address in Debian/ Ubuntu, open the following file:
# nano /etc/network/interfaces
You may see a line looking like this:
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
Change it so it looks like this:
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static 
  address 192.168.0.100
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.0.1
  dns-nameservers 4.4.4.4
  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
Save the file and then edit /etc/resolv.conf like this:
# nano /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 8.8.8.8 # Replace with your nameserver ip
nameserver 4.4.4.4 # Replace with your nameserver ip
Restart the networking on your system with:
# /etc/init.d/network restart  [On SysVinit]y
# systemctl restart network    [On SystemD]
Your static IP address has been configured.
nameserver 67.207.67.3
nameserver 67.207.67.2
